# Decentralized Motion
 A Research project to create a Decentralized Motion System.

# Demo / Download
`- Expect soon -`

***

# Research
This project will completely document and explain all methods and techniques for this system for any uses. As this is a research project, all and any code from this project is completely free for use or edition. Any possibile reality dimensions will be demonstrated and distributed, hopefully extending into quantum mechanics.

# The main focus
The absolute focus for this project is to mimic the chaos that is our reality, a decentralized system of motion and physics where anything can break for any number of reasons or create. Though we aren't working on graphical systems as of yet, we will expand into so once this is completed.

# Explanation of all realitys
1D. 1D: 
    - Pure system, text.
2D. 2D: 
    - Flat system with position, scale, and imaginary time.
3. 3D: 
    - Spatial system with imginary time, not effected by constant flow.
4. 4D: 
    - The temporal dimension that we exist in, random chaos among chaos.

***
Dimensions beyond this point are theoretically impossible to exist.

5. 5D: 
    - Alternative/Parallel reality
6. 6D: 
    - Multiverse
7. 7D: 
    - Impossibily complex reality; new natures of reality and physics.
8. 8D: 
    - Infinity
9. 9D: 
    - A constant collapsing system of all and any rules and natures.
